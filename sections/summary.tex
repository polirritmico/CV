\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}

    I am a developer, musician, and educator graduated from the Pontificia
    Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. My experience spans teaching, artistic
    production, and research, always applying software solutions and
    specializing in the advanced use of various Linux systems and programming
    environments.

    I am interested in generating quality code aligned with modern standards. I
    envision development as an iterative process supported by the feedback from
    a robust testing suite. I pay attention to details such as variable, class,
    and function names alongside the efficiency and encapsulation of algorithms.

    As a versatile professional passionate about learning, I seek to integrate
    into constructive work environments, directing my interest towards teams
    that embrace integration and continuous deployment standards, as well as
    automation and testing practices.
