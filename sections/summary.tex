\cvsection{About}

\begin{cvparagraph}

    I am a developer, musician, and educator graduated from the Pontificia
    Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. I am interested in creating solutions
    through high-quality code, aligned with modern standards and paying
    attention to detail. I envision development as an iterative team process
    supported by the feedback from a robust testing suite.

    My experience includes, among others, creating scripts and internal tools,
    test automation, data loading, pipelines, web scraping, low-latency
    software, and advanced use of various Linux systems.

    As a versatile professional passionate about technology and learning, I
    seek to join constructive and continuously improving teams and work
    environments.
