\cvsection{Professional Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}

I am a developer, musician and educator graduated from the Pontificia
Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile with over 15 years of experience in the fields of
teaching, artistic production and technology.

I have primarily worked on integrating software and hardware solutions in
artistic and educational fields. Since 2005, I have been gaining experience in
\lsc{GNU}/Linux environments such as Gentoo, Fedora, SuSE, among others; as
well as gaining advanced proficiency in office suites, audio editing,
\lsc{MIDI}, vector images and various programming languages and environments.

I am a professional with a genuine interest in continuous learning and
acquiring new experiences in constructive work environments where I can
contribute effectively. I am interested in being part of a team that seeks
solutions that deliver value to both users and the organization itself
through the creation or improvement of tools and procedures that contribute
technically and humanly.
